## **About me**
IT is a field that accepts people from different fields, and I am very glad that I am not an exception. I graduated from the Faculty of History, the Academy of Music and the Theological Seminary. Being a creative person, I understand that I want to “create” in the field of IT.
I have no experience in IT, but thanks to companies that are ready to take people without work experience, I believe that it will be soon.
